A basic web application for serving different types of machine learning algorithms for molecular property prediction, specifically hERG and BBBP.
Machine learning algorithms include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Feedforward Neural Networks,  Graph Neural Networks and are provided in separate
docker containers using different environments. Deep Learning based algorithms expect GPU access.
Note that model weights are not included here neither is the training pipeline used to provide models.
